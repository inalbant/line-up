This app requires an API token to work.

Please create a `.env` file in the root directory with a `VITE_API_TOKEN` key and the value of the API token.

So it'd look like:

`VITE_API_TOKEN=eyJhb...`

And then you can run the app with `npm run dev`.

p.s. This app is tested with Node v20 so please use v20.
